2008.07.16

* Applied a patch from Moshe Zadka: "When getting a long reply, the client
library, using code from xmlrpclib, will attempt to call feed multiple times
with partial messages. The supplied parser assumes feed will only be called
with a complete message."

2006.05.06

* Added a beginning sketch of JSON over TCP in protocols.json.
* Some protocol tweaks.
* Added test top-level directory as well as an adytum.twisted-level test
directory.
* Converted a.t.w2.jsonrpc and the client portion of a.t.w.jsonrpc to use the
NetstringReceiver protocol for JSON-RPC over TCP.
* Removed protocol code, since we don't need a custom protocol for JSON-RCP
over TCP.
* Commented out the support for returning a dict with keys "result" and
"error" as it seems like unessary overhead for now. Someone convince me
otherwise, and I'll put it back in.
