Request
-------

A remote method is invoked by sending a request to a remote service. The
request is a single object serialized using JSON.

It has three properties:

* method - A String containing the name of the method to be invoked.

* params - An Array of objects to pass as arguments to the method.

* id - The request id. This can be of any type. It is used to match the
  response with the request that it is replying to. Due to the nature of
  callbacks in Twisted, this property is not needed nor used by txJSON-RPC.
  In the version 1.0 spec, it is provided for the sake of compatibility.

The following imported function is not public and not intended for regular use
as part of the API. Its use here is for spec-compliance demonstration only::

    >>> from txjsonrpc.jsonrpclib import ServerProxy, VERSION_1
    >>>
    >>> proxy = ServerProxy("http://some.url", version=VERSION_1)
    >>> proxy._getVersionedRequest("myfunc", ["arg1", "arg2", "arg3"], "anid")
    '{"params": ["arg1", "arg2", "arg3"], "method": "myfunc", "id": "anid"}'

# XXX add async examples for web, web2, and netstring


Response
--------

When the method invocation completes, the service must reply with a response.
The response is a single object serialized using JSON.

It has three properties:

    * result - The Object that was returned by the invoked method. This must be
      null in case there was an error invoking the method.

    * error - An Error object if there was an error invoking the method. It
      must be null if there was no error.

    * id - This must be the same id as the request it is responding to. Due to
      the nature of callbacks in Twisted, this property is not needed nor used
      by txJSON-RPC.  In the version 1.0 spec, it is provided for the sake of
      compatibility.
