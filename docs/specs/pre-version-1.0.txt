Request
-------

A remote method is invoked by sending a request to a remote service. The
request is a single object serialized using JSON.

It has two properties:

* method - A String containing the name of the method to be invoked.

* params - An Array of objects to pass as arguments to the method.

The following imported function is not public and not intended for regular use
as part of the API. Its use here is for spec-compliance demonstration only::

    >>> from txjsonrpc.jsonrpclib import _preV1Request
    >>> _preV1Request("myfunc", ["arg1", "arg2", "arg3"])
    '{"params": ["arg1", "arg2", "arg3"], "method": "myfunc"}'
